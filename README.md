## 🎯 Gameplay

### Basic Rules:
1. Control the snake using the arrow keys ←↑↓→
2. Eat fruits to grow and earn points
3. When eating a fruit, the snake changes to the fruit's color
4. Eat several fruits of the same color in a row for combo bonuses
5. Avoid collisions with your own body!

### Scoring System:
- Regular fruit: +10 points
- Combo: +15-1500 points (depending on series length)
- Level: Increases when the snake reaches a certain length

## 💡 Why Vanilla JS?

We consciously avoided frameworks to:
- **Minimize size** - only 6 files, < 100KB
- **Simplify launch** - no dependency installation required
- **Enhance performance** - direct access to Canvas API
- **Educational purposes** - clean, readable JavaScript
- **Compatibility** - works anywhere a browser exists
